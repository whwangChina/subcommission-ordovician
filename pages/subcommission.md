Dr. Thomas SERBVAIS is Research Director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), based at the University of Lille. Trained as a geologist and palaeontologist in Namur and Liège (Belgium), he continued post-doctoral research in Berlin (Germany) and at the British Geological Survey (Keyworth-Nottingham, UK), working on the biostratigraphy, palaeoecology and palaeogeography of different fossil groups, in particular the enigmatic microfossil group of the acritarchs.


### Vice Chairs

E-mail: <stigall@utk.edu>  
<br />

Alycia STIGALL is Jones/Bibee Professor and Head of the Departmen of Earth, Environmental & Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. She grew up collecting fossils from the Upper Ordovician strata of the Cincinnati Arch, and she earned her BS from Ohio State University and MS and PhD at the University of Kansas. She completed post-doctoral reserach at Ohio State University, was a visiting resarch professor at Yale Univeristy, and spent 18 years on faculy in teh Department of Geological Sciences at Ohio University. In addition to her work on the Subcommision on Ordovician Stratigraphy, Alycia has served in numerous roles for the Paleontological Society and was a co-leader of IGCP 653: The onset of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event. 

Alycia's research focuses on using marine benthos (typically brachiopods) to examine the relationships between diversification, extinction and biogeography with ecological and earth systems changes. Recent work has emphasized understanding diversification processes and feedback loops during the Great Ordovician Biodiversfication Event and biotic response to dispersal and invasion events including the Katian Richmondian Invasion using a combination of phylogenetic, ecological niche modelling, paleoecological, and biogeographic analyses. She has worked extensively documenting species invasions, speciation patterns and processes, and niche evolution within Laurentian taxa.

<br />

ZHAN Renbin, a research professor at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (NIGP), earned his bachelor degree in Nanjing University in June 1986, and PhD at NIGP in June 1994. He spent one year in the Natural History Museum London doing postdoc with Dr. Robin Cocks as his host from December 1996 to December 1997. Beginning from 1999, Renbin was invited to visit the Western University (formerly called the University of Western Ontario) and the Laurentian University 8 times with a duration from 13 to 3 months collaborating with Prof. Jisuo Jin and Prof. Paul Copper respectively. He is now the vice chair of ISOS, secretary-general of International Palaeontological Association (IPA), Editor-in-Chief of Palaeoworld, Associate Editor of Journal of Paleontology, and a member of the editorial board of Alcheringa. As the organizer or one of the co-organizers, he has already organized 6 international symposia, conferences and congresses in China for the Lower Paleozoic community since 1998.

Working on the Early Paleozoic (mainly Ordovician and Silurian) brachiopods and stratigraphy for more than 30 years, Zhan Renbin has published 8 systematic monographs and close to 300 peer-reviewed papers dealing with several Ordovician and Silurian brachiopod faunas from South China, North China, Tarim, Sibumasu, North America, etc. He has also initiated the case studies on the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) in China, and discovered several basic characteristics of GOBE including the diversity pattern, paleoecological style, and paleogeographical control.


### Secretary

**Annalisa FERRETTI**  
Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche  
Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia   
via Campi 103, 41125 Modena, ITALY     
Tel: +39-059-2058470
E-mail: <ferretti@unimore.it>  
<br />

Annalisa FERRETTI is an Associate Professor of Paleontology at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. She earned her PhD at the same University and a post-Doc at the University of Victoria B.C. (Canada). She is the President of the Italian Paleontological Society.

Annalisa Ferretti is interested in biostratigraphic analysis and she specifically focuses on the use of conodont faunas (taxonomy, biostratigraphy, paleogeography, paleoecology) in the Cambrian-Ordovician time frame. Additional interests include the analysis of bioapatite crystal-chemistry and of diagenetic effects on phosphate biomaterial. She has also worked on the study of microbiofacies and biosedimentology in the Silurian-Devonian, with particular emphasis on the analysis of deposits rich in organic matter.

Bertrand LEFEBVRE is a specialist of Ordovician echinoderms (in particular ‘carpoids’). He studied in London (UK) and Lyon (France), where he defended his PhD in 1999. He was then recruited as CNRS researcher in Dijon (France) in 2001, and since 2007, he is back in Lyon. He was president of the French Palaeozoic Working Group (GFP, 2004-2011) and of the French Stratigraphic Committee (CFS, 2012-2015). In the past 20 years, he was largely involved in the description of the Lower Ordovician Fezouata Biota (Morocco), contributing to advances on palaeontological, sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and taphonomic aspects of this Lagerstätte.
